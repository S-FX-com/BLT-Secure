# BLT Secure — Task Board

## Phase 1 — Hardening Baseline

### Local hardening

- [x] **Login slug rename** — `wp-login.php` hidden behind a custom slug.
  - AC: `GET /{slug}` serves the login form; `GET /wp-login.php` and unauthenticated `/wp-admin/*` return 404 (except `admin-ajax.php` / `admin-post.php`); password-reset email links use the new slug; `postpass`, `logout`, `rp`, `confirm_action`, interim-login flows all work; `BLT_SECURE_DISABLE_SLUG` constant restores default; feature disabled on multisite; off by default.
- [x] **Login lockout** — N failed attempts → temporary block.
  - AC: 5 failures (default) from one IP or against one username → generic error, no timing/count leak; success clears counters; thresholds/window configurable; alert event fired on lockout; IP resolved via CF-aware resolver.
- [x] **TOTP 2FA** — optional per-user, policy-enforceable.
  - AC: enrollment via QR (client-side render) + manual code; completes only after a valid code; codes verify at ±1 window with replay guard; 8 single-use recovery codes shown once, stored hashed; interstitial rate-limited; policies optional / required for admins / required for all; un-enrolled users under a "required" policy are nagged, not locked out.
- [x] **File editing disabled** — `file_mod_allowed` filter when `DISALLOW_FILE_EDIT` not already set. AC: theme/plugin editors gone from wp-admin; constant state shown read-only in UI.
- [x] **File-manager plugin blocker** — filterable slug list.
  - AC: install blocked at `upgrader_pre_install`; activation links stripped; already-active blocked plugin is auto-deactivated with an admin notice; every block fires an alert event.
- [x] **Security headers** — HSTS, X-Frame-Options, nosniff, Referrer-Policy, starter CSP.
  - AC: headers on front-end + login, never CSP on wp-admin; HSTS only over SSL, `includeSubDomains`/`preload` behind separate checkboxes; pre-existing same-name headers are not duplicated; CSP defaults to Report-Only.
- [x] **Hide WP version + block user enumeration.**
  - AC: no generator tag; `?ver={core}` stripped from enqueues only when equal to core version; `?author=N` → 404 for visitors incl. the canonical-redirect leak; REST `/wp/v2/users*` → 401 for logged-out.
- [x] **XML-RPC kill switch** — default off.
  - AC: when off, `xmlrpc.php` answers with a fault before parsing; pingback methods and `X-Pingback` header gone; toggle re-enables cleanly; UI warns about Jetpack/mobile apps.

### Cloudflare edge (token-gated)

- [x] **Token setup** — verify, zone discovery, encrypted storage.
  - AC: token verified via `/user/tokens/verify`; zone auto-discovered from `home_url`; account_id read from zone object; token stored encrypted (autoload=no); salt rotation detected → re-prompt notice, no silent failures.
- [x] **Managed WAF deploy** — CF Managed Ruleset (wordpress emphasis) + OWASP.
  - AC: idempotent (ref-reconciled); paranoia + sensitivity controls redeploy via PATCH; free-plan zones get the Free Managed Ruleset with honest card copy.
- [x] **Custom rules pack** — ASN challenge, TOR challenge, sensitive-path block.
  - AC: three rules with `blt-secure-*` refs; removable individually as a pack; other tenants' rules untouched.
- [x] **Rate limiting** — login + xmlrpc + custom slug, 5/60s → 600s block.
  - AC: single rule (free-plan budget); local slug change marks deployment stale in UI.
- [x] **Leaked credentials** — detection on `log`/`pwd` fields + challenge rule.
  - AC: zone check enabled + custom detection + companion rule; degraded gracefully by plan.
- [x] **Cloudflare Access app** — wp-admin + login slug, admin-email allow policy, admin-ajax bypass.
  - AC: 403 scope probe renders card disabled with exact token-fix instructions; app + policies removable.

### Manual smoke checklist (run on wp-env or a staging site before tagging a release)

- [ ] Activate plugin: no notices/fatals with WP_DEBUG on.
- [ ] Rename login slug → old URL 404s, new URL logs in, reset-password email link works.
- [ ] 5 bad passwords → locked out; correct password after window works.
- [ ] Enroll 2FA with a real authenticator app; log in with code; burn a recovery code.
- [ ] `curl -sI` front page and login: expected headers present, none duplicated.
- [ ] `curl -s -X POST /xmlrpc.php` → fault response.
- [ ] Try installing wp-file-manager → blocked with notice.
- [ ] Configure a real free-plan CF zone token → verify, deploy all five cards, confirm rules in CF dash, remove all five, confirm gone.
- [ ] Deactivate → CF rules untouched, notice shown. Uninstall with cleanup opted in → options/meta gone (including PUC's `external_updates-blt-secure` option and cron hook).
- [ ] **Updates end-to-end:** install a CI-built release zip on staging, add a GitHub token (Advanced tab), force a check (Dashboard → Updates → "Check again"), confirm the update row shows the newer version + changelog, run the update, confirm the plugin folder is still `blt-secure/` and the plugin stays active.
- [ ] Public-repo updates: with no token configured, no "updates cannot be checked" notice appears; a real newer release is still detected and installs. (No-token warning only returns if `blt_secure_updates_repo_public` is filtered to false.)
- [ ] Health Check: open the Health Check tab → "Run checks now" → score + grouped pass/warn/fail results render; confirm the daily `blt_secure_health_scan` cron event is scheduled; confirm a fresh page load with no scan does NOT make the self-HTTP request (results come from the stored option).
- [ ] Settings restyle: on Hardening/Login/Advanced, toggles flip and save correctly (each section saves without wiping another); the read-only `DISALLOW_FILE_EDIT` toggle is disabled but reflects the constant; selects/number fields still persist; keyboard focus ring shows on toggles.
- [ ] Core scanner: open the Scanner tab → "Scan core files now" → verified-count/version render and the flagged-files list appears if any core file is modified/missing (temporarily edit a core file to confirm it is caught, then restore); confirm the `core_integrity` check appears under Files & Permissions on the Health Check tab; confirm the daily `blt_secure_core_scan` cron event is scheduled.
- [ ] Release workflow dry run: temporarily add a `test/release-dry-run` branch trigger with `draft: true` on the release step, push, download + unzip-verify the draft asset, then remove the test trigger. (workflow_dispatch only appears once the workflow file is on main.)

## Phase 2 — Detection & Monitoring (in progress)

- [x] **Health Check** — on-demand + daily WP-Cron security self-assessment (~50 checks) with a pass/warn/fail score.
  - AC: checks framework (`includes/health/`) is read-only and side-effect free; scan runs only on cron/AJAX, never on a front-end page load; results stored in the non-autoloaded `blt_secure_health_results` option; score = passed / (passed + failed), warnings/skips excluded; a check that throws is downgraded to SKIP; "Health Check" tab shows score gauge, tallies, and grouped results; catalogue is extendable via the `blt_secure_health_checks` filter (the core/malware scanners below append their own checks here).
- [x] **Core integrity scanner** — verifies WordPress core against the official wp.org md5 checksums (the "core scanner").
  - AC: fetches checksums via core's `get_core_checksums()` (direct api.wordpress.org fallback); flags `modified`/`missing`/`unknown` files under wp-admin, wp-includes, and root wp-*.php only (wp-content excluded so deleted default themes/plugins are not false positives); pure diff helpers (`classify`, `unknown_files`, `in_scope`) unit-tested; runs on a daily `blt_secure_core_scan` WP-Cron worker and on demand; latest result stored in the non-autoloaded `blt_secure_core_scan_results` option; issue list capped at 200; a Scanner tab lists flagged files; a `core_integrity` summary check feeds the Health score via `blt_secure_health_checks`; an alert fires when issues are found.
- [ ] Plugin/theme baseline integrity (hash-baseline installed plugins/themes, diff on schedule, re-baseline on update) — extends the scanner beyond core, where no wp.org checksums exist.
- [ ] YARA-based scanner via Pressidium ruleset + signature-base (pure-PHP subset fallback for shared hosting) — *the "malware scanner"*
- [ ] IOC blocklist sync (ThreatFox, Spamhaus DROP) → push to CF IP List / custom rule
- [ ] CF firewall event ingestion → unified timeline
- [ ] Suspicious wp-admin activity log (new admins, plugin installs, cron changes)
- [ ] Malicious upload detection (CF signal + local pass on /uploads)
- [ ] Wire feeds/feeds.json loader (pluggable feed sources)

## Phase 3 — Fleet Management (not started)

- [ ] Central dashboard (CF Workers + D1)
- [ ] Worker/KV credential store backend (swap for Blt_Secure_Encrypted_Option_Store)
- [ ] Slack/email alerting channels behind Blt_Secure_Alerting
- [ ] Scheduled feed updates w/ changelog
- [ ] Client-facing status page / trust badge
